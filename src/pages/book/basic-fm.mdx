# Basic financial mathematics

## Cashflows

Cashflows are money that is paid or received at a certain time. In the code below, `cashflows[i]` is the amount of money paid or received at time `i` where `i` represents the number of years since the present.

```python
cashflows = [100, 200, -50, 100, 100]
```

This is visualized in textbooks using a "time diagram".

## Accumulated value

If you invest 1 dollar, how much money will you have in a year? The answer is more than a dollar. How much more? It depends on the interest rate. If the interest rate is 5%, then you will have $1 \cdot (1+ 0.05) = 1.05$ dollars. This is called the accumulated value of a dollar in 1 year.

- $i$ is the interest rate.
  - We assume the interest rate to be constant for this discussion.
  - If we have $1$ dollar today, we can invest it and it will become $1+i$ dollars in a year with an annual interest rate of $i$. In two years this will compound and we will have $(1+i)^2$ dollars. In $n$ years we will have $(1+i)^n$ dollars.

We can do an accumulation calculation in Python using a `for` loop, it will sum up the cashflows and project them forward with interest. The result is a list where `result[i]` is the accumulated value of the cashflows with interest at time `i`. The interest rate is assumed to be constant.

## Present value

Just like we can project cashflows forward with interest, we can also project them backward. If we have $1$ dollar in a year, how much is it worth today? Well, if we have $v$ dollars and invest it today to get $1$ dollar in a year, then $v(1+i) = 1$ and $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$. This is the present value of a dollar in 1 year.

- $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ is the **discount factor**.
- $v$ is the **present value** of a dollar one year from now.

We can calculate the present value of cashflows.

## Annuities

An annuity is a series of payments that are made at regular intervals. There are two types of annuities.

- Annuity-immediate: payments are made at the end of each period.
  - I have no idea why the annuity-immediate doesn't pay immediately (at the beginning of the period).
- Annuity-due: payments are made at the beginning of each period.

Here are 5-payment annuities with payments of 100 dollars. We can calculate the present value of these annuities.

## Quick maths

Actuarial exams require to be very fast at implementing these calculations by hand for special cases that have closed-form solution. Here is some of the math you might find in an introductory financial mathematics course.

When the interest rate and payments are constant, there is a closed form for the present value of cashflows.

$$
\begin{align}
PV &= a + av + av^2 + \cdots + av^{n-1} \\
&= a \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v^i \\
&= a \frac{1 - v^n}{1 - v}
\end{align}
$$

where $a$ is the constant payment, $i$ is the interest rate, $n$ is the number of payments, and $v = \frac{1}{1+i}$ is the discount factor.

To find the closed form for geometric series, we consider the general case for a truncated geometric series and then discuss the infinite case.

A truncated geometric series is given by:

$S_n = a + av + av^2 + \cdots + av^{n-1}$

Here, $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio.

We can find the closed form for $S_n$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
S_n &= a + av + av^2 + \cdots + av^{n-1} \\
vS_n &= av + av^2 + \cdots + av^{n-1} + av^n \\
\end{align}
$$

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation cancels out all but the first and last terms:

$$
\begin{align}
vS_n - S_n &= av^n - a \\
S_n(v-1) &= a(v^n - 1) \\
S_n &= a \frac{v^n - 1}{v - 1}
\end{align}
$$

So, the closed form for a truncated geometric series is $S_n = a \frac{v^n - 1}{v - 1}$.

Quiz: Can you use the same subtraction technique from the proof to solve for the Arithmetico-geomtric series?

$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a + id) v^i
$$

# Introduction

## Hosting Streamlit apps in Python

- The easy way: Streamlit community cloud.
- The general solution: Publish a docker image and run the container somewhere.

We focus more on the general solution.

## Chainladder

- I don't know much about casualty actuarial work so I will not be able to discuss the meaning behind what we are doing in this blog post.
- I do know that the Casualty Actuarial Society has published a library for making triangles that has become the most starred actuarial GitHub repository in history.

So let's make some triangles.

# The code

- `@st.cache_data` caches the data when we load it so that the application can refresh without reloading the data.
- Streamlit will output any lines that are just expressions, like a single line that just says `triangle`.
- `lob = st.selectbox("Line of Business", clrd.index)` creates a selection box with labels that come from a [list-like thing](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/widgets/st.selectbox).
  - The choice from the selection box is stored as `lob`
  - This variable can be referenced, like in `st.markdown("This is a triangle for " + lob + " and " + column + ".")`

```py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import chainladder as cl

st.markdown("# Hosting actuarial dashboards in Streamlit")
st.markdown("Here is the top 10 rows from a big rectangle of data. We want to get triangles from this rectangle.")
n=10
@st.cache_data(ttl=3600*10)
def get_data():
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casact/chainladder-python/master/chainladder/utils/data/clrd.csv"
    )
clrd_df = get_data()
clrd_df_head = clrd_df.head(n)
clrd_df_head
st.markdown("""Casualty actuaries create reports with \"loss triangles\".
For the triangles we use the [chainladder-python](https://chainladder-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) package. This package is published by the Casualty Actuarial Society and is
the [most popular open source actuarial project ever](https://www.actuarialopensource.org/).""")
st.markdown("""We host the loss triangles on the web using streamlit, the [most popular open source python package for hosting dashboards](https://star-history.com/#streamlit/streamlit&plotly/dash&rstudio/shiny&Date).""")

clrd = cl.Triangle(
    clrd_df,
    origin="AccidentYear",
    development="DevelopmentYear",
    columns=[
        "IncurLoss",
        "CumPaidLoss",
        "BulkLoss",
        "EarnedPremDIR",
        "EarnedPremCeded",
        "EarnedPremNet",
    ],
    index="LOB",
    cumulative=True,
)

st.write("Selectors")

lob = st.selectbox("Line of Business", clrd.index)

column = st.selectbox("Type", clrd.columns)

triangle = clrd.loc[lob, column]

st.markdown("This is a triangle for " + lob + " and " + column + ".")

triangle

st.markdown("This is a heatmap of the link ratio.")

st.write(triangle.link_ratio.heatmap())
```

You should be able to get this code to run if you have Python and `requirements.txt` installed.

```
chainladder==0.8.15
streamlit==1.21.0
pandas==1.5.3
IPython==8.12.0
```

# The Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is instructions to set up the machine and run the software.
This Dockerfile is mostly copied from [docs.streamlit.io](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/deploy/docker).

```
# app/Dockerfile

FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    software-properties-common \
    git \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY . .

RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt

EXPOSE 8501

HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health

ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit", "run", "main.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

# Deployment

There are many ways to deploy a thing. We will be using **GitHub actions** to automate the building and pushing of Docker images to **DockerHub** before deploying to **Azure Container Instances**.

- GitHub actions: Like BitBucket Pipelines, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, TeamCity, etc.
- DockerHub: Like GitHub/Amazon/Google/Microsoft's container registry. Or you could host your own registry.
- Azure Container Instances: Like Amazon ECS, Google Cloud Run, Kubernetes, or anything with Docker installed.

The benefit of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is that you don't need to maintain a word document that says which buttons to press.
The behavior of the deployment is defined by a text file that lives in a Git repository.

```yaml
name: Publish Docker image

on:
  push:

jobs:
  push_to_registry:
    name: Push Docker image to Docker Hub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

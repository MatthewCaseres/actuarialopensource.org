# Welcome

This is where we do our best to produce open source educational materials. You can collapse/expand the sidebar with the button in the bottom left.

Some of our work contains interactive Python playgrounds.

<CodeEditor
  code={
    '\n\nprint(2+2)\nprint([x**2 for x in range(5)])\nprint([(i,j) for i in range(10) for j in range(10) if (i+j)%2])'
  }
/>

Some content is written by GPT-4, some isn't, and some is partially. The content written mostly by GPT-4 goes in the "GPT generated" section of the sidebar.
This content will be improved by human reviewers and leave the "GPT generated" section eventually.

I think our coolest page so far is <Link href="/book/gpt-4/memoization">GPT-4 discussing of life insurance model caching code</Link>.

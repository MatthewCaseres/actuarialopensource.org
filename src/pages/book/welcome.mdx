# Welcome

This is where we do our best to produce open source educational materials. You can collapse/expand the sidebar with the button in the bottom left.

Some of our work contains interactive Python playgrounds.

<CodeEditor
  code={
    'from itertools import groupby\n\nprint([list(g) for k, g in groupby("aabbbbaaababaa")])\nprint(2+2)\nprint([x**2 for x in range(5)])'
  }
/>

Some content is written by GPT-4, some isn't, and some is partially. The content written mostly by GPT-4 goes in the "GPT generated" section of the sidebar.

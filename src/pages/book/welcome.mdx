# Welcome

This is where we do our best to produce open source educational materials. You can collapse/expand the sidebar with the button in the bottom left.

Some of our work contains interactive Python playgrounds.

<CodeEditor
  code={
    'print("You can run code on this website.")\nprint("slow connections take time to load Python")'
  }
/>

We are mostly working on an introduction to life insurance modeling in Python. Although some of the directories in this book are unrelated.

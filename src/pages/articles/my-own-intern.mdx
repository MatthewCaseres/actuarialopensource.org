I put 5,000 USD into an account to fund an internship for actuarial students to write open source software.
I no longer have the income that I had when I made this decision, and will have to be my own intern.
I am willing to work for 10 USD per hour, less than the planned 20 USD per hour for an intern.

500 USD will be billed for work done by myself up to this point in time. Here are some projects I have done:

* Building this website
  * The LinkedIn group is not discoverable on search engines
  * This website is ranked #1 for searches on Google and Bing queries like "Open Source Actuary"
* Pymort
  * Python users have an interface to interact with mortality tables from the SOA
* Benchmarks
  * Benchmarks now run and report results automatically using GitHub Actions

The challenge is now creating some impact with the remaining 450 hours billable hours.

## What is the goal?

Very few actuarial publications are reproducible. There are some reasons for this:

* No open data sets
* Proprietary modeling platforms
* Marketing material about the capabilities of a consultancy are often favored over knowledge sharing
* Interests of academia are not fully aligned with the operational realities of actuarial departments
* Microsoft Excel

The things in the above bullet points are not some great evil, they are just the way that the world works. 
If we want to see change we will have to do an honest effort at creating reproducible research, 
and then we can see if anyone wants to join us.

Specifically, we need to build a data simulator. Then we need to see if anyone will use the simulated data.

# Welcome

This is where we do our best to produce open source educational materials. You can collapse/expand the sidebar with the button in the bottom left.

Some of our work contains interactive Python playgrounds. The buttons on the top right of the editor can run the code or restore the code to its original state.
The most recently used code editor will execute faster than the others. File imports should work the way you expect them to.

<CodeEditor
  id="d4b61647-99e4-43de-86b9-0ae59bbc819c"
  tabs={[
    {
      title: 'main',
      content:
        "import shapes\n\nshapes.draw_triangle(5)\nprint('\\n\\n')\nshapes.draw_square(5)\n",
    },
    {
      title: 'shapes',
      content:
        "def draw_triangle(height):\n    for i in range(height):\n        print('  ' * (height - i - 1) + '**' * (2 * i + 1))\n\ndef draw_square(height):\n    for i in range(height):\n        print('**' * height)",
    },

We are working an introduction to life insurance modeling in Python, but this project is in its early stages.

This book and website are open source and under - https://github.com/actuarialopensource/actuarialopensource.org.

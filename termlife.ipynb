    "Remember that actuarial science predates computers. A [reference on Actuarial notation](https://www.casact.org/sites/default/files/database/proceed_proceed49_49123.pdf) traces it's origins to the 1800s:\n",

    "> The existing international actuarial notation was founded on the 'Key to the\n",
    "Notation' given in the Institute of Actuaries Text-Book, Part II, Life Contingencies, by George King, and is embodied in an explanatory statement\n",
    "adopted unanimously by the Second International Actuarial Congress held in\n",
    "London in May 1898 and printed on pp. 618-40 of the Transactions of that\n",
    "Congress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to computers, actuarial calculations used in the insurance industry were done on paper. The notation was designed to be easy to write and flexible. We will largely avoid it because it is not easy to type on a computer and much of the same information can be conveyed using Python code."
